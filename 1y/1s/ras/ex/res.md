##### 3.6.1

1. **Correction**: (or correctness) is a property that establishes the equivalence between a system and its specification. A system is functionally correct if it behaves in accordance to the specification of the functionalities it provides.

2. **Reliability**: is the capacity of a system to continue in operation over time and is related to the probability of a system producing correct results in a given period of time.

3. **Robustness**: is related to the capacity of a system to behave “reasonably”, even in circumstances that were not anticipated during the requirements engineering process.

4. **Perfomance**: refers to the capacity of a system to respond to its stimulus, i.e., the time necessary for responding to the events or the number of events processed by time unit.

5. **Facility of utilisation**: (or user friendliness) is a subjective property that refers to how human users find a given system easy to use.
   
6. **Verifiabilty**: is related to how easy it is to verify the properties of a software system.

7. **Maintainability**: is the ease with which a system can be maintained in order to correct defects or their cause, repair/replace faulty components without having to replace still working parts, and meet new requirements. Maintainability is sometimes called modifiability.

8. **Reparability**: is the ability of a given system to be restored to acceptable operating condition with a limited amount of work and within a specified period. It is related to the ability of a software defect to be easily repaired.

9.  **Evolvability**: is a measure of how easily a system can be changed to accommodate new features or to modify existing ones.

10. **Reusability**: means designing a system so that its structure (or part of it) can be reused. It is akin to evolvability.

11. **Portability**: is the ability of the system to run under different computing environments.

12. **Comprehensibility**: (or understandability) is concerned with understanding the software system. It can
be related to internal or external qualities of the system under consideration. From an internal perspective, it helps in achieving other qualities, like evolvability and verifiability. From an external perspective, a system is understandable if the user finds its behaviour predictable.

13.  **Interoperability**: is the property of a system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to coexist and cooperate with other systems without any restricted access or implementation.

14.  **Productivity**: Productivity is a quality of the software development process and measures the efficiency of the process. An efficient process delivers the systems faster.

15.  **Actuality**: (or timeliness) is a business- and process-related attribute that is concerned with the ability to deliver a software system on time. It requires solid project management techniques to obtain timeliness.

16.  **Visibility**: measures how visible are the steps of a given software process. A software development process is said to visible if all of its steps and its current states are documented clearly.

#### 4.1

**Elicitation** handles how requirements should be captured. The requirements elicitation techniques must identify the sources of requirements and should also aid the various stakeholders to correctly describe the requirements. This activity is inherently communicational, since it requires an in-depth interaction with the stakeholders.

**Negotiation** in general consists in a collective search for regulating the divergencies and its result can have a significative impact on the acceptance of the final system. Another form of handling conflicts consists in adopting prioritisation techniques, to sustain the choice of the requirements subset to be implemented at each instant.

**Documentation** (this term can be used to refer to the activity of documenting, but also to its result) is important since it serves as the principal reference to the subsequent phases of the development process. To ensure a good structure, quality, and verifiability, the requirements document is normally organised according to two distinct perspectives:
user requirements (that describe the expectations and the necessities of the users) and system requirements (that establish the agreement between the client and the development team).

#### 4.2

One of the main objectives of requirements engineering consists in establishing communication channels between the holders of the problem (i.e., the users and the clients) and those that will construct a solution (i.e., the systems engineers). The requirements must be managed by requirements engineers, jointly with representatives of the client, key users and other domain specialists. However, communication problems between requirements engineers and users are common. Users have generally some difficulties in expressing their real necessities, in a perceptible and precise way. Moreover, in many situations, the users only have a vague idea of what they really want. Users and engineers have very different perspectives with respect to the nature of the problem, so they also have different understandings. Even in the cases in which the users have a total awareness of their necessities, something that seldom happens, it is not simple to transfer or verbalise that information.
The use of technical terminology may introduce communication problems, since it implies that the stakeholders are using terminology of the solution domain. In fact, user requirements should be described with the problem domain terminology. If this recommendation is followed, it is more likely that the requirements can be focused on the questions associated with the problem that is being addressed. Engineers should avoid to speak with the terminology of the technological domain of the system under development. If one proceeds this way, the premature inclusion of solution domain issues is avoided.

### 7.

#### 7.1

Option 2. Requirements documented in a natural language are easier to understand. Natural languages are neither precise nor unambiguous.

#### 7.2

1 - Non functional (??? ambiguious)
2 - Non functional (perfomance)
4 - Non functional

Answer: 3. System requirements include both functional and non-functional requirements. (3) is a design statement describing the architecture of the software system. (1) and (2) are valid non-functional requirements. (4) is a valid functional requirements.

#### 7.3

1. This is a non-functional requirements (usability).
2. No. A person trained for five hours should be able to use 80% of the basic functionalities of the system.


#### 7.4

The email message contains reference to a product (video game console) that is projected to be used inside
a family car.

Functional requirements:
R1: The console should turn off when there is no interaction for more than 10 min.
R2: The console should be put in standby when the driver is making a phone call.
R3: The passenger can transport the console from one car to another one.

Non-functional requirements:
R4: The console should weight less than 2 kg.

Marketing constraints:
R4: The price should be £50.

#### 7.5

(a) and (d).
The word "gradually" makes R3 (a) ambiguous and (d) not verifiable. To solve this issue, the requirement would be "R3: The level of the water should increase between 2 and 4 mm/min."

#### 7.6

R5: One should not state for how often the system will fail. Instead, we can require it to be available, for example, 360 days a year.
R6: The word "minimal" is ambiguous. "The system shall be easy to learn by students with two hours of training."
R7: The users in this case seem to be drivers. To which operation does the delay relate? Probably, the delays for car drivers and truck drivers are different. "The average delay for the car driver to pay a toll shall be less than 15 s."
R8: There is not sufficient information to decide if this requirement is clear. Users are probably not forced to use the application, even if available. "All users shall have access to the same mobile application."
R9: Where does reception occur? By whom? Why?"Organisers shall be able to confirm each questionnaire within half an hour of its submission by the respondents."
R10: The reference to the mobile phone is a design restriction. Additionally, it is recommended to add an acceptance criterion for performance. "The operator shall be able to communicate with the bus driver within 5 seconds."

#### 7.7

R11: Instead of saying “instantaneous answers”, one should quantify it.
“The truck driver shall be able to obtain answers in less than 2s, if he provides a recognised voice command.”

R12: It seems that the system will anyway be turned off if the electrical cable is unplugged. So, the stakeholders who proposed this requirement should be contacted to ask them to explain better what they actually need.

R13: The level of normal operation must be quantified. “The fire extinguishing subsystem must activate when the temperature is above 30o C.”

R14: It is not clear what is an unexpected fault in the controller system. The requirement must start with the indication of the user.
“The operator shall be able to stop the escalator with no danger to the pedestrians, even if the controller system fails.”


#### 7.8

R15: The expression ‘in the system’ is redundant. The characteristics of the web interface should be removed and document in a different non-functional requirement. “The student shall be able to submit his group’s program.”

R16: This sentence includes two requirements: “The professor shall be able to assign an assistant to each submitted Ruby program.” and “The assistant shall be able to revise the Ruby programs assigned to him.”

R17: This requirement should be stated positively. It should also start by mentioning the user that benefit from it. “The assistant shall be assigned a program of a group that has no conflict of interest.”

R18: The expression “as soon as possible” must be removed. These four sentences include two requirements: “The assistant shall be able to edit comments about the respective revised programs.” “The professor shall be able to introduce the mark of each program based on the available comments produced by the assistants.”

#### 7.9


1. The word “her” may refer either to Jane or to Margret.

2. It is not clear if the adjective “single” applies to both aunts and daughters or just to aunts. If we want the first alternative, the sentence should be written as “The invitation was sent to daughters and single aunts”. If the objective is the second alternative, the sentence looks like “The invitation was sent to single daughters and single aunts”.

3. One is not sure if the responsibility belongs to banks or companies.

4. These two groups (children and pensioners) are expected to be disjoint, since a pensioner is a person who collects a pension, most commonly because of a retirement from the workforce. So, there are no single person that is at simultaneously a pensioners and a child. In this case, the two possible beneficiaries of the discount are the children and the pensioners

5. This sentence has the same interpretation as the previous one, due to the disjoint nature of both groups of beneficiaries of the discount.

6. With plural names, like parents, it is unclear (1) if the elements are acting individually or collectively, and (2) if the elements of a group are acting individually, whether they must all act in unison. In this sentence, there are three possible ways for the parents (a father and a mother) of a child to answer:
- One (and only one) of the parents acknowledge the messages.
- The parents shall each acknowledge the messages.
- The parents, acting collectively, acknowledge the messages.
