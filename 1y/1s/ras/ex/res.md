##### 3.6.1

1. **Correction**: (or correctness) is a property that establishes the equivalence between a system and its specification. A system is functionally correct if it behaves in accordance to the specification of the functionalities it provides.

2. **Reliability**: is the capacity of a system to continue in operation over time and is related to the probability of a system producing correct results in a given period of time.

3. **Robustness**: is related to the capacity of a system to behave “reasonably”, even in circumstances that were not anticipated during the requirements engineering process.

4. **Perfomance**: refers to the capacity of a system to respond to its stimulus, i.e., the time necessary for responding to the events or the number of events processed by time unit.

5. **Facility of utilisation**: (or user friendliness) is a subjective property that refers to how human users find a given system easy to use.
   
6. **Verifiabilty**: is related to how easy it is to verify the properties of a software system.

7. **Maintainability**: is the ease with which a system can be maintained in order to correct defects or their cause, repair/replace faulty components without having to replace still working parts, and meet new requirements. Maintainability is sometimes called modifiability.

8. **Reparability**: is the ability of a given system to be restored to acceptable operating condition with a limited amount of work and within a specified period. It is related to the ability of a software defect to be easily repaired.

9.  **Evolvability**: is a measure of how easily a system can be changed to accommodate new features or to modify existing ones.

10. **Reusability**: means designing a system so that its structure (or part of it) can be reused. It is akin to evolvability.

11. **Portability**: is the ability of the system to run under different computing environments.

12. **Comprehensibility**: (or understandability) is concerned with understanding the software system. It can
be related to internal or external qualities of the system under consideration. From an internal perspective, it helps in achieving other qualities, like evolvability and verifiability. From an external perspective, a system is understandable if the user finds its behaviour predictable.

13.  **Interoperability**: is the property of a system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to coexist and cooperate with other systems without any restricted access or implementation.

14.  **Productivity**: Productivity is a quality of the software development process and measures the efficiency of the process. An efficient process delivers the systems faster.

15.  **Actuality**: (or timeliness) is a business- and process-related attribute that is concerned with the ability to deliver a software system on time. It requires solid project management techniques to obtain timeliness.

16.  **Visibility**: measures how visible are the steps of a given software process. A software development process is said to visible if all of its steps and its current states are documented clearly.

#### 4.1

**Elicitation** handles how requirements should be captured. The requirements elicitation techniques must identify the sources of requirements and should also aid the various stakeholders to correctly describe the requirements. This activity is inherently communicational, since it requires an in-depth interaction with the stakeholders.

**Negotiation** in general consists in a collective search for regulating the divergencies and its result can have a significative impact on the acceptance of the final system. Another form of handling conflicts consists in adopting prioritisation techniques, to sustain the choice of the requirements subset to be implemented at each instant.

**Documentation** (this term can be used to refer to the activity of documenting, but also to its result) is important since it serves as the principal reference to the subsequent phases of the development process. To ensure a good structure, quality, and verifiability, the requirements document is normally organised according to two distinct perspectives:
user requirements (that describe the expectations and the necessities of the users) and system requirements (that establish the agreement between the client and the development team).

#### 4.2

One of the main objectives of requirements engineering consists in establishing communication channels between the holders of the problem (i.e., the users and the clients) and those that will construct a solution (i.e., the systems engineers). The requirements must be managed by requirements engineers, jointly with representatives of the client, key users and other domain specialists. However, communication problems between requirements engineers and users are common. Users have generally some difficulties in expressing their real necessities, in a perceptible and precise way. Moreover, in many situations, the users only have a vague idea of what they really want. Users and engineers have very different perspectives with respect to the nature of the problem, so they also have different understandings. Even in the cases in which the users have a total awareness of their necessities, something that seldom happens, it is not simple to transfer or verbalise that information.
The use of technical terminology may introduce communication problems, since it implies that the stakeholders are using terminology of the solution domain. In fact, user requirements should be described with the problem domain terminology. If this recommendation is followed, it is more likely that the requirements can be focused on the questions associated with the problem that is being addressed. Engineers should avoid to speak with the terminology of the technological domain of the system under development. If one proceeds this way, the premature inclusion of solution domain issues is avoided.
